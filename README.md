## Requirements

* Windows
* [fceux 2.2.3](http://fceux.com/web/home.html)
	* May work on earlier versions, but it's untested

## TODO 

The priority of the following work will likely be dictated by requests.

* Add names to key locations on overworld map (towns and caves)
* Add chest and search spot tracker
* Add spot to record search item coordinates
* Add general notes section
* Fix intermittent bugs with enemy skills and stopspell resistance
* Mesen support
	* I started this, but I'm no Cheat Engine pointer path genius. I'll likely need a little help here for this to get completed.
